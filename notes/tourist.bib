  abstract = "Newly available datasets present exciting opportunities to
              investigate how human population movement contributes to the
              spread of infectious diseases across large geographical
              distances. It is now possible to construct realistic models of
              infectious disease dynamics for the purposes of understanding
              global-scale epidemics. Nevertheless, a remaining unanswered
              question is how best to leverage the new data to parameterize
              models of movement, and whether one's choice of movement model
              impacts modeled disease outcomes. We adapt three well-studied
              models of infectious disease dynamics, the
              susceptible-infected-recovered model, the
              susceptible-infected-susceptible model, and the Ross-Macdonald
              model, to incorporate either of two candidate movement models. We
              describe the effect that the choice of movement model has on each
              disease model's results, finding that in all cases, there are
              parameter regimes where choosing one movement model instead of
              another has a profound impact on epidemiological outcomes. We
              further demonstrate the importance of choosing an appropriate
              movement model using the applied case of malaria transmission and
              importation on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, finding that one
              model produces intelligible predictions of R0, whereas the other
              produces nonsensical results.",

  abstract = "As Africa-wide malaria prevalence declines, an understanding of
              human movement patterns is essential to inform how best to target
              interventions. We fitted movement models to trip data from
              surveys conducted at 3-5 sites throughout each of Mali, Burkina
              Faso, Zambia and Tanzania. Two models were compared in terms of
              their ability to predict the observed movement patterns - a
              gravity model, in which movement rates between pairs of locations
              increase with population size and decrease with distance, and a
              radiation model, in which travelers are cumulatively ``absorbed''
              as they move outwards from their origin of travel. The gravity
              model provided a better fit to the data overall and for travel to
              large populations, while the radiation model provided a better
              fit for nearby populations. One strength of the data set was that
              trips could be categorized according to traveler group - namely,
              women traveling with children in all survey countries and youth
              workers in Mali. For gravity models fitted to data specific to
              these groups, youth workers were found to have a higher travel
              frequency to large population centers, and women traveling with
              children a lower frequency. These models may help predict the
              spatial transmission of malaria parasites and inform strategies
              to control their spread.",
