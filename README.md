# Tourist Index for Travel Models

A travel model predicts where a population will travel and sometimes how often
that population will travel. This work seeks to augment a kernel-based travel
model with covariates that predict the fraction of people in a place that came
from other places. It's called the tourist index.

There will be likelihoods, probabilistic programming, some Julia, and some R.
